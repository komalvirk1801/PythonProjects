**DATASET**


With Diwali around the corner, it's the perfect time to analyze sales trends that skyrocket during this festive season in India. Diwali is a festival of lights, joy, and immense shopping as families purchase everything from clothing and electronics to gifts and home decor.

In the Diwali Sales Data Analysis Project, we cleaned and transformed the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, ensuring consistent formats and handling missing or incorrect values. After preparing the data, we used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization to explore key sales trends, customer demographics, and product preferences.

This project highlights the power of data-driven storytelling by revealing insights into consumer behavior during one of the most vibrant shopping seasons in India. Through analysis, retailers can tailor their strategies to boost sales, maximize engagement, and optimize inventory management.
