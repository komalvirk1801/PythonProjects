### Data Analysis on Brain Stroke dataset Using Python

**Problem Statement:** 
Brainstroke, a leading cause of disability and death globally, presents a significant challenge in medical research and healthcare. Despite advances in medical technology, predicting and understanding the factors contributing to brainstroke remain complex and crucial for improving patient outcomes.

The objective of this analysis is to examine a comprehensive brainstroke dataset to identify key patterns and factors associated with the incidence of brainstroke. The dataset includes various patient attributes such as demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements.

Key Questions to Address:

 - What are the primary risk factors associated with brainstroke? Analyze the dataset to identify and quantify the impact of different risk factors such as age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and physical inactivity on the likelihood of brainstroke.

- How do different factors interact to influence brainstroke risk? Explore interactions between various factors to understand their combined effects on brainstroke risk and uncover any significant correlations or patterns.

- What insights can be derived to support clinical decision-making and public health strategies? Generate actionable insights from the data that can inform healthcare professionals and policymakers in designing effective prevention and intervention strategies for brainstroke.

**Scope:**

The analysis will focus on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and the application of statistical and machine learning techniques to uncover meaningful insights. The ultimate goal is to contribute valuable knowledge that can support efforts in reducing brainstroke incidence and improving patient care.

**Skills:**  Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, correlation matrices.

**Technology:**  Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

### Data Analysis on Traffic Road Accidents Using Python.

**Problem Statement:** Analyze the severity of road traffic accidents to understand the factors contributing to high accident rates on a monthly basis. This involves examining:

1. Weather conditions (e.g., wet/damp roads, dry conditions)
2. Time of day (daytime vs. nighttime)
3. Road type (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway)
4. Festival days
5. Additionally, conduct a geographic analysis to identify the city with the highest number of accidents.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, correlation matrices. 

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

### DIWALI SALES DATA ANALYSIS

**Problem Statement:** With Diwali around the corner, it's the perfect time to analyze sales trends that skyrocket during this festive season in India. Diwali is a festival of lights, joy, and immense shopping as families purchase everything from clothing and electronics to gifts and home decor.

In the Diwali Sales Data Analysis Project, we cleaned and transformed the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, ensuring consistent formats and handling missing or incorrect values. After preparing the data, we used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization to explore key sales trends, customer demographics, and product preferences.

This project highlights the power of data-driven storytelling by revealing insights into consumer behavior during one of the most vibrant shopping seasons in India. Through analysis, retailers can tailor their strategies to boost sales, maximize engagement, and optimize inventory management.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, correlation matrices. 

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

## Coin Market Website Web scrapping and data analysis

**Problem Statement:**

**Analyzing Market Performance and Trading Dynamics of Cryptocurrencies:** The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the market performance of leading cryptocurrencies by comparing their key metrics: price, market capitalization, 24-hour trading volume, and circulating supply. This analysis will investigate the following:

**Market Capitalization Analysis:**

Identify how different cryptocurrencies rank in terms of market capitalization.  
Assess the dominance of top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the overall crypto market.  

**Price Comparison:**

Compare the price trends across top cryptocurrencies and evaluate which are considered high-value versus low-cost alternatives.    
Highlight any significant price gaps and trends that might indicate market interest or speculative trading patterns.  

**Volume Traded vs. Market Cap Correlation:**

Explore the relationship between the 24-hour trading volume and the market capitalization to understand liquidity and investor activity.  
Determine whether high market cap cryptocurrencies also exhibit high trading volumes or if there are outliers.  

**Market Cap Distribution:**

Visualize how the total market capitalization is distributed across the top 10 cryptocurrencies.  
Analyze the share of smaller, emerging cryptocurrencies relative to the market giants to identify growth potential and diversification in the crypto space.
